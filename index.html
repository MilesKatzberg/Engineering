    <p>1/10/23 - We starteded to make a car out of a mouse trap, our 
    design involves a car with CD wheels and electrical tape as the grip.
    We used wooden sticks as our axle for our wheel. We used that same wooden 
    stick as a extension of the mouse trap to increase the length it could pull
    the car</p>
    
    <p>1/30/23 - Our car worked! it went far enough to go halfway across the 
    cafeteria floor. I got a good grade on it and I know I did the best I 
    possibly could have.</p>
    
    <p>3/24/23 - We started an egg drop contest.We started with a list of materials and 
    sketched out a CAD of our project. It consists of tape and straws. The egg will be 
    in the middle and the egg will be safe because the straws will absorb the blow of 
    the egg. Also it is light weight so it won't go down as hard.</p>
    
    <p>4/10/23 - We started to make a boat big enough to hold 2 people.
    We will float in a race across the pool. We need to make sure that 
    it will float when 2 people are in it, We will have the 2 people sit one infront 
    of the other is the boat and use hand paddles to row forward</p>
    
    <p>5/15/23 - We made our boat and it is ready. We ran out of tape faster
    than we wanted to but it is ok. We wanted to make our boat very long but 
    thats when we ran out of tape. We had to bend up the back but we made
    it nice and added a window to the back.</p>

    <p>6/6/23 - It has been. while sinse an update because not much as changed, 
    but we have finished the class and our project. we were forced to cut our boat
    to be shorter than we had hoped but we were able to make a cool design out of it.
    Our boat did not do as well as we had hoped and basically failed immediatly. I am 
    still happy with it though even if it failed.</p>
